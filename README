	== UnusedPkg 0.6 ==

UnusedPkg is a diagnostic tool to find unused packages in your Linux system sorted by idle time. This helps you determine what packages are old and can be manually removed to get more space and keep system clean. It supports any apt-based distribution (tested on Debian and Ubuntu) and Slackware.

By default UnusedPkg collect information only of packages containing binary program files placed in $PATH environment variable.
Use -a option to disallow the default behaviour and get timestamp statistics of every kind of packages.

You can run it from any place, ore move script to /usr/bin/.

	= Known issues =

Package analysis of unusedpkg is purely indicative, because a single file with a wrong access timestamp can compromise the number of idle days of an entire package. The unusedpkg analysis can be faked because usually files are touched by

  * Commands that browse entire filesystem
  * Post install scripts (Especially in slackware, some packages post install scripts can move files after installation)

Warning: to avoid to undelete useful packages, before uninstalling any packet, check manually timestamps with 'info' options. Use unusedpkg at your own risk.
